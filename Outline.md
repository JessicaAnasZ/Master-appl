# My graduate schools application (2019 Fall)

## Brief info. about me

I am a student at a university in Hong Kong. I chose programs in computational biology, statistics, biostatistics, and bioinformatics in Europe and North America. I applied for master programs four different areas in US: stat, biostat, bioinformatics, finance.

GRE: 327 (V157, Q170, W3)
TOEFL: 101 (R28 L29 S20 W25)
wGPA: 3.52 / 4.00
Competitions: None
Recommendation from top: None

I did not put the document containing my personal info. in this repository so if you need something just email me and I will get to you asap.

## Document required or used during application

It's a good idea to get a folder for each program and keep the "universal" files under other folders for easy management.

1. [Course description](01_course_description/):
Some schools like ETH, UZH would ask for all the courses you've taken or will be taking. Better prepare one at the first place and it really doesn't matter if you're taking those courses at the last semester.
2. [Letter of Recommendation](02_letter_of_recommendation):
This could easily be the most important materials during the application since the standard tests for all application do not differ that much **I guess !**. If you've got yourself a **STRONG** letter for one of the top faculties or top leaders in the field, you are pretty much set for the application. But for norms like me, it's simply better to get the endorsement from someone that is close to you and have sent a considerate amount of time working with you. It is also crucial to make sure they do not say anything negative in the letter. *I didn't attached mine for the sack of privacy*
3. [CV](03_cv):
Just use a template and it's available all over the Internet. **DO NOT** try anything fancy. Just list out all the things you participated and contributed.
4. [Standard Test](05_gre_toefl):
Always keep a digital copy for easy uploading.
5. [Transcripts](06_transcript):
Nothing to say but you need to submit all the grades: exchange, summer schools, etc. But I heard some would not report summer schools if they don't have a good grade.
6. [Research Proposal](07_research_proposal):
Writing sample and proposals are must for PhD but not for all master unless it is research-oriented but there exist very few those master as far as I know for computational biologist.
7. Other Files:
Financial statement/bank statement and other specfic files.
8. Make sure you write down the details of your address, info. about who recommend you, Test score in a plain text file because you have to copy and paste a lot of time.

Rolling basis

The first deadline for submitting the deposit is Feb 28, I ask for an extension for a month. Not gonna go because of the high tuition fee.

Good for someone in Financial industry and want to enhance their quantative background. For me, they have a strong list of PhD courses such as modern analysis, probability theory. But all things considered, I just don't want to take intro. to probability again and go over some of the math course maybe in more or less details. Overall, good for someone who to develop or build a foundation in quantitative science.

Good for someone who really want to continue research/career in computational biology field.

Good for someone who wants to further dig in the field of computational biology (NOT CS). My guess is that it won't be so easy for someone coming from this program to find a software engineer job. But great if you consider going into this field as a data analyst or PhD perhaps. The pay is actually decent.

Different tracks available during application but successful applicants may switch tracks once admitted. (At least that's what I heard from other).

Update at mid April, it is not a nice move that they offered now since I have made the decision and most schools set their decision deadline at Apr 15. Not cool! Not cool at all! NYU

This program has changed from BIC to Artificial Intelligence and Entrepreneurship. My friend got admitted but my first priority is Computational Biology and they probably stop reviewing your materials after you've been offered another program at the same school. 

It's really career-based and I am quite confident this Master will help you land a job easily. Good! But it's probably gonna be much more competitive next year considering the wave of AI bull sh$t.

```text
Please describe your previous academic work in your proposed field of study and include a personal statement regarding your goals for graduate study and a professional career. Please also describe any relevant research experience and what you have learned from it, and other educational and life experiences that you feel are important and relevant. If you have specific interests in your proposed field of study or are interested in working with any particular faculty members, please tell us about them.

Word maximums may vary by program. Please review program application instructions for more information.

I am applying to the M.S. or Ph.D. program. Am I required to provide three faculty names in the CS Interest Form?

This is not required. But, we strongly encourage you to identify at least three CS faculty with whom you might want to work if admitted. Please explore the CS faculty profiles on our website if you are not familiar with the research interests of our faculty. CS faculty are also listed by research area.
```

Got rejected. Will ask them why. But my guess is the lack of cs courses. This program is quite CS concentrated.

Compared to the computational biology at CMU, this definitely will help a lot when I was considering a job at the tech companies. But in that way, they perfer someone with a CS degree **I guess!**
